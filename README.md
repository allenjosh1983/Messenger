Getting Started
To set up and run Barkeep locally:
# Install dependencies- This installs required packages (fastapi, uvicorn)

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch server- this starts the app in live-reload mode 
uvicorn app.main:app --reload



# Access the app
Once running, open a browser and visit:
http://127.0.0.1:8000
This is the default URL for FastAPI apps running on localhost with port 8000. 


- Test in multiple tabs
Open two browser windows and enter different usernames to see live message broadcasting with timestamps.
