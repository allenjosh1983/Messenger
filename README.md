Getting Started
To set up and run Barkeep locally:
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
This installs required packages (fastapi, uvicorn) and starts the app in live-reload mode 


- Access the app
Open a browser and visit:
http://Perfect ‚Äî here‚Äôs your updated Installation section with the default URL clearly noted:

üõ† Installation
To set up and run Barkeep locally:
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload


Once running, your app will be accessible at:
http://127.0.0.1:8000
This is the default URL for FastAPI apps running on localhost with port 8000. 



Would you like me to reassemble the full README with this included, or are you planning to paste it into place manually? I‚Äôve got it queued up if you want the complete file.



- Test in multiple tabs
Open two browser windows and enter different usernames to see live message broadcasting with timestamps.
